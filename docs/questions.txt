APPLICATION:TRANSACTION_ID: Where does it come from;
APPLICATION:MM_ID: What is this?
PROGRAM_APP_TYPE:PRG_APP_TYPE_ID: This column is a VARCHAR2 and looks like the other string PK columns but the data looks more akin to a sequence

just confirming because I saw the code
    there are explicit sequences for the numeric primary keys and they are generated by the db?

I also saw there were already triggers to populate created, updated and by who, so I am going to disable my code so long as they are on all of them
